# Chain-Reaction

This repository contains the source code of my bot for the Battle of Bots Challenge - Chain Reaction hosted on HackerEarth.
The class `ChainBoard` denotes a Board object which specifies a snapshot of a particular model of the game.

The file `Chain Reaction - DFS.py` contains code for a bot which goes one level deep and calculates the best possible move the opponent can make
and rates the current move on basis of that.
